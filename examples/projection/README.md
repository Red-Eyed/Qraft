# Small projection × quantization methods

Minimal deterministic ONNX MatMul without downloaded data. This example measures mean squared error and maximum absolute error.

Start at [`run()` in main.py](main.py), then follow `run_variant()`, `sample_source()` in
[`model.py`](model.py), and `recipes()` in the same entry point. The example writes the workflow directly instead of delegating it to a suite.

## What the code demonstrates

`model.py` constructs `y = x @ w` directly in ONNX with an 8 × 4 FP32
weight matrix. `sample_source()` binds a seed and batch count so every pass
regenerates the same sixteen-row input batches without retaining them.

Read `recipes()` in `main.py`: this example uses `QuantizationConfig()` directly,
`PercentileConfig` for clipping, and `smoothquant=True` for two-stage rescaling
followed by MinMax. `run_variant()` calls `quantize()` and `evaluate()` explicitly.
Separate calibration/evaluation seeds make the measured errors held-out errors.

The ONNX input contract is `x`: float32 `[16, 8]`. Configuration is in [`schema.py`](schema.py).
All chosen recipes start from the same FP32 graph and use the same calibration
selection. The input factory is called again when fresh statistics are required.

## MinMax

```sh
uv run --locked --group examples -m examples.projection.main --methods minmax
```

Use the complete observed interval for static W8A8. The code configures
`StaticW8A8()` (or `QuantizationConfig()` in the projection).

## Percentile

```sh
uv run --locked --group examples -m examples.projection.main --methods percentile
```

Clip activation outliers before static W8A8. The code configures
`QuantizationConfig(calibration=PercentileConfig(percentile=config.percentile))`.
`--percentile 99.99` and `--histogram-bins 2048` expose the clipping controls.

## SmoothQuant

```sh
uv run --locked --group examples -m examples.projection.main --methods smoothquant
```

The stages are `(smoothing, minmax)`: `SmoothQuant(alpha=config.smoothquant_alpha)`
first balances channels, then a fresh calibration pass applies `StaticW8A8()`.
`--smoothquant-alpha` controls the balancing exponent. Smoothing alone is not the
INT8 result.

## Compare columns

```sh
just example projection
just example projection --methods minmax,percentile
just example projection --help
```

Omitting `--methods` runs all three columns. Reports go to
`artifacts/projection/index.html`, `results.json`, and `summary.md`. The directory
also contains FP32/INT8 ONNX graphs and full per-stage `.plan.json` decisions.
`--output` chooses another directory; `--quiet` disables progress and `--json`
prints the report as JSON. Downloads and output setup are automatic.

## Apply it to your task

Replace `example_model()` with `onnx.load()` for your FP32 graph. Replace `sample_source()` with a factory yielding your real input mappings. Keep `recipes()`, `quantize()`, and `evaluate()` as the minimal workflow; select operators explicitly if your graph contains unsupported/dynamic weights.

The Qraft boundary in the example is deliberately small:

```python
outcome = quantize(
    fp32,
    sample_source(config.calibration_seed, config.calibration_samples),
    recipes(config)[QuantizationMethod.PERCENTILE].stages(),
    histogram_bins=config.histogram_bins,
)
```

Model training, datasets, and HTML reports are demonstration scaffolding; Qraft
needs the FP32 ONNX graph, a replayable input factory, and the selected stage rules.
The result contains `model` and inspectable `plans`, or a typed `Err` diagnostic.
