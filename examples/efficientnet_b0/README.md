# EfficientNet-B0 × quantization methods

Pretrained image classification sensitive to calibration choices. This example measures ImageNet accuracy and calibration-related regressions.

Start at [`run()` in main.py](main.py), then follow `export_onnx()` (for Torch
models), `calibration_samples()`, and the quantization configuration in the same
file. The example writes the workflow directly instead of delegating it to a suite.

## What the code demonstrates

`load_model()` explicitly loads `EfficientNet_B0_Weights.IMAGENET1K_V1`
with its own transforms. The example includes depthwise convolutions and
squeeze/excitation blocks, so preprocessing and calibration choices matter.

The original 256-image experiment measured 75.00% FP32 top-1, 44.92% with MinMax,
and 69.53% with Percentile. These are historical subset measurements, not promises
for a new run. Start with the Percentile column and compare it with MinMax;
`--percentile` controls the clipping mass. The local selector also shows why
grouped depthwise Conv is excluded from smoothing but remains statically quantizable.

The ONNX input contract is `images`: float32 `[1, 3, 224, 224]`. Configuration is in [`schema.py`](schema.py).
All chosen recipes start from the same FP32 graph and use the same calibration
selection. The input factory is called again when fresh statistics are required.

## MinMax

```sh
uv run --locked --group examples -m examples.efficientnet_b0.main --methods minmax
```

Use the complete observed interval for static W8A8. The code configures
`StaticW8A8()` (or `QuantizationConfig()` in the projection).

## Percentile

```sh
uv run --locked --group examples -m examples.efficientnet_b0.main --methods percentile
```

Clip activation outliers before static W8A8. The code configures
`StaticW8A8(calibration=Percentile(percentile=config.percentile))`.
`--percentile 99.99` and `--histogram-bins 2048` expose the clipping controls.

## SmoothQuant

```sh
uv run --locked --group examples -m examples.efficientnet_b0.main --methods smoothquant
```

The stages are `(smoothing, minmax)`: `SmoothQuant(alpha=config.smoothquant_alpha)`
first balances channels, then a fresh calibration pass applies `StaticW8A8()`.
`--smoothquant-alpha` controls the balancing exponent. Smoothing alone is not the
INT8 result.

## Compare columns

```sh
just example efficientnet_b0
just example efficientnet_b0 --methods minmax,percentile
just example efficientnet_b0 --help
```

Omitting `--methods` runs all three columns. Reports go to
`artifacts/efficientnet_b0/index.html`, `results.json`, and `summary.md`. The directory
also contains FP32/INT8 ONNX graphs and full per-stage `.plan.json` decisions.
`--output` chooses another directory; `--quiet` disables progress and `--json`
prints the report as JSON. Downloads and output setup are automatic.

## Apply it to your task

Replace the checkpoint and matching preprocessing. Use representative calibration images instead of choosing a clipping value from this small experiment alone. Replace category/output validation for your own classes, then compare held-out accuracy across the matrix columns.

The Qraft boundary in the example is deliberately small:

```python
outcome = quantize(
    fp32,
    calibration_samples(calibration, loaded),
    recipes(config)[QuantizationMethod.PERCENTILE],
    histogram_bins=config.histogram_bins,
)
```

Model training, datasets, and HTML reports are demonstration scaffolding; Qraft
needs the FP32 ONNX graph, a replayable input factory, and the selected stage rules.
The result contains `model` and inspectable `plans`, or a typed `Failure` diagnostic.

[Back to the model × method matrix](../README.md).

Imagenette train images calibrate; val images evaluate. The default is 128/256
images. Labels stay in the checkpoint's full 1,000-class ImageNet space. Timings
use warmed optimized CPU ORT; QDQ does not itself promise faster inference.
