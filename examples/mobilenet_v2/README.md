# MobileNetV2 × quantization methods

Read [`main.py`](main.py) for the workflow. To run this example, use the
commands below from the repository root.

Pretrained image classification with depthwise convolutions. This example measures ImageNet accuracy and changes in predicted classes.

Start at [`run()` in main.py](main.py), then follow `export_onnx()` (for Torch
models), `calibration_samples()`, and the quantization configuration in the same
file. The example writes the workflow directly instead of delegating it to a suite.

## What the code demonstrates

`load_model()` explicitly loads `MobileNet_V2_Weights.IMAGENET1K_V2` and
the checkpoint's transforms. This architecture combines pointwise convolutions,
grouped depthwise convolutions, and a classifier; it is not a residual-CNN alias.

Read the grouped-convolution condition in `ConstantWeights.matches()`. Ordinary
static quantization includes depthwise layers. SmoothQuant excludes grouped Conv
because QuantSmith's rescaling supports ungrouped Conv; the following MinMax stage
still quantizes supported depthwise weights. The real val-image gallery shows
whether class predictions change.

The ONNX input contract is `images`: float32 `[1, 3, 224, 224]`. Configuration is in [`schema.py`](schema.py).
All chosen recipes start from the same FP32 graph and use the same calibration
selection. The input factory is called again when fresh statistics are required.

## MinMax

```sh
uv run --locked --group examples -m examples.mobilenet_v2.main --methods minmax
```

Use the complete observed interval for static W8A8. The code configures
`StaticW8A8()` (or `QuantizationConfig()` in the projection).

## Percentile

```sh
uv run --locked --group examples -m examples.mobilenet_v2.main --methods percentile
```

Clip activation outliers before static W8A8. The code configures
`StaticW8A8(calibration=Percentile(percentile=config.percentile))`.
`--percentile 99.99` and `--histogram-bins 2048` expose the clipping controls.

## SmoothQuant

```sh
uv run --locked --group examples -m examples.mobilenet_v2.main --methods smoothquant
```

The stages are `(smoothing, minmax)`: `SmoothQuant(alpha=config.smoothquant_alpha)`
first balances channels, then a fresh calibration pass applies `StaticW8A8()`.
`--smoothquant-alpha` controls the balancing exponent. Smoothing alone is not the
INT8 result.

## Compare columns

```sh
uv run --locked --group examples -m examples.mobilenet_v2.main
uv run --locked --group examples -m examples.mobilenet_v2.main --methods minmax,percentile
uv run --locked --group examples -m examples.mobilenet_v2.main --help
```

Omitting `--methods` runs all three columns. Reports go to
`artifacts/mobilenet_v2/index.html`, `results.json`, and `summary.md`. The directory
also contains FP32/INT8 ONNX graphs and full per-stage `.plan.json` decisions.
`--output` chooses another directory; `--quiet` disables progress and `--json`
prints the report as JSON. Downloads and output setup are automatic.

## Apply it to your task

Replace the pretrained builder and matching preprocessing for your mobile model. Keep the grouped-convolution check if you use depthwise layers. Replace image sources, categories, and classifier-output validation for your task; compare measured quality before choosing a method.

The QuantSmith boundary in the example is deliberately small:

```python
outcome = quantize(
    fp32,
    calibration_samples(calibration, loaded),
    recipes(config)[QuantizationMethod.PERCENTILE],
    histogram_bins=config.histogram_bins,
)
```

Model training, datasets, and HTML reports are demonstration scaffolding; QuantSmith
needs the FP32 ONNX graph, a replayable input factory, and the selected stage rules.
The result contains `model` and inspectable `plans`, or a typed `Err` diagnostic.

[Back to the model × method matrix](../README.md).

Imagenette train images calibrate; val images evaluate. The default is 128/256
images. Labels stay in the checkpoint's full 1,000-class ImageNet space. Timings
use warmed optimized CPU ORT; QDQ does not itself promise faster inference.
