# Character RNN × quantization methods

Read [`main.py`](main.py) for the workflow. To run this example, use the
commands below from the repository root.

Secondary recurrent next-character prediction example. This example measures token accuracy, perplexity, and recurrent predictions.

Start at [`run()` in main.py](main.py), then follow `export_onnx()` (for Torch
models), `calibration_samples()`, and the quantization configuration in the same
file. The example writes the workflow directly instead of delegating it to a suite.

## What the code demonstrates

`model.py` shows character embeddings, an `RNNCell`, explicit recurrent
state, and a vocabulary head. Each fixed context starts with zero state; this is
not a stateful serving or KV-cache example. `torch.onnx.export` exposes the shared
recurrent projections during fixed-length inference.

`calibration_samples()` preserves int64 token IDs. QuantSmith quantizes the constant
recurrent/head weights; it does not turn embeddings or all recurrent arithmetic
into integer operations. This is a secondary example after the Transformers.

The ONNX input contract is `tokens`: int64 `[1, 32]`. Configuration is in [`schema.py`](schema.py).
All chosen recipes start from the same FP32 graph and use the same calibration
selection. The input factory is called again when fresh statistics are required.

## MinMax

```sh
uv run --locked --group examples -m examples.character_rnn.main --methods minmax
```

Use the complete observed interval for static W8A8. The code configures
`StaticW8A8()` (or `QuantizationConfig()` in the projection).

## Percentile

```sh
uv run --locked --group examples -m examples.character_rnn.main --methods percentile
```

Clip activation outliers before static W8A8. The code configures
`StaticW8A8(calibration=Percentile(percentile=config.percentile))`.
`--percentile 99.99` and `--histogram-bins 2048` expose the clipping controls.

## SmoothQuant

```sh
uv run --locked --group examples -m examples.character_rnn.main --methods smoothquant
```

The stages are `(smoothing, minmax)`: `SmoothQuant(alpha=config.smoothquant_alpha)`
first balances channels, then a fresh calibration pass applies `StaticW8A8()`.
`--smoothquant-alpha` controls the balancing exponent. Smoothing alone is not the
INT8 result.

## Compare columns

```sh
uv run --locked --group examples -m examples.character_rnn.main
uv run --locked --group examples -m examples.character_rnn.main --methods minmax,percentile
uv run --locked --group examples -m examples.character_rnn.main --help
```

Omitting `--methods` runs all three columns. Reports go to
`artifacts/character_rnn/index.html`, `results.json`, and `summary.md`. The directory
also contains FP32/INT8 ONNX graphs and full per-stage `.plan.json` decisions.
`--output` chooses another directory; `--quiet` disables progress and `--json`
prints the report as JSON. Downloads and output setup are automatic.

## Apply it to your task

Replace the local recurrent model and character vocabulary with your sequence task. Decide explicitly how hidden state is initialized or passed at inference. Export that contract, replay representative inputs, and evaluate your sequence metric on held-out data.

The QuantSmith boundary in the example is deliberately small:

```python
outcome = quantize(
    fp32,
    calibration_samples(data),
    recipes(config)[QuantizationMethod.PERCENTILE],
    histogram_bins=config.histogram_bins,
)
```

Model training, datasets, and HTML reports are demonstration scaffolding; QuantSmith
needs the FP32 ONNX graph, a replayable input factory, and the selected stage rules.
The result contains `model` and inspectable `plans`, or a typed `Err` diagnostic.

[Back to the model × method matrix](../README.md).

Training uses disjoint 80/10/10 text spans and a training-only vocabulary. The
default is 600 CPU steps, 64 calibration contexts, and 128 held-out contexts.
These are small trained character models, not pretrained language-model benchmarks.
